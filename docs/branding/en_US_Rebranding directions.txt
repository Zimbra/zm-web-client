REBRANDING ZWC HELP TOPICS - HOW TO CHANGE VARIABLES 

The Zimbra Web Client Help can be rebranded to replace reference to Zimbra and the Zimbra product  name with your company and product names.

The default variables  in the file ZbMsg.properties are as follows:

"web client long name" - ClientNameLong = Zimbra Web Client
"web client short name" - ClientNameShort = ZWC
"Your company name" - CompanyName = Zimbra
"This variable is not relevant.  Do not change" - DesktopName = Zimbra Desktop
"product full name" - CollaborationProductFullName = Zimbra Collaboration Suite
"product short name" - CollaborationProductShortName = ZCS

To change these variables

1. SSH to the Zimbra server

2. As Zimbra change directory to the following directory
/opt/zimbra/jetty/webapps/zimbra/WEB-INF/classes/messages/

3. To change the values, edit ZbMsg.properties.  Replace the Zimbra name with your company name. DO NOT CHANGE OR REMOVE THE VARIABLE DESCRIPTOR.

4. Restart the server.  Type zmcontrol restart.

5. Reload the Help in the browser. 

Step 5 may require a forced browser reload or a clearing of the browser cache.

Note: When you upgrade ZCS, changes made to the ZbMsg.properties file are lost. We recommend that you make a copy of the changed file to restore after upgrades.
