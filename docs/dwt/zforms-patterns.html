<h1>ZForm Usage Patterns</h1>
<p>
	With any new framework there is a tendency to make mistakes, both
	in designing and implementing the framework as well as using it.
	Designers frequently architect the framework to solve every
	imaginable problem.
	And developers tend to use the framework in a way it was never
	meant to be used.
	With this understanding, this document intends to enumerate a few
	accepted usage patterns for the ZForms framework.
	It is hoped that, by reading this document, the designers and
	developers get the most use out of the framework and resist the
	urge to add or bend the framework in unsuitable ways.
