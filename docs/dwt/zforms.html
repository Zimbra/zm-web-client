<h2>About</h2>
<p>
	ZForms is an attempt to reduce the effort of laying out multiple
	related controls, hooking up event listeners, and managing them.
	It eliminates redundant code throughout the application by removing
	the need for the application author to write this same code over
	and over again, resulting in more productivity and less errors.
</p>
<p>
	The goals of ZForms include:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>small size</li>
	<li>simplicity and consistency</li>
	<li>use existing template system</li>
	<li>bind controls to arbitrary data objects</li>
	<li>determining values that are dirty/invalid</li>
</ul>

<h2>Background</h2>
<p>
	The DWT toolkit already contains a form-based infrastructure
	called XForms, roughly based on the
	<a href='http://www.w3.org/MarkUp/Forms/'>W3C XForms</a>
	specification. 
	The Zimbra Collaboration Suite's administration console is
	written largely using this framework.
</p>
<p>
	The client team for the Zimbra Collaboration Suite refused to adopt
	the XForms implementation for a variety of reasons.
	Some of the reasons for this decision were:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>large size</li>
	<li>complexity</li>
	<li>lack of debugging (due to generated code)</li>
	<li>restrictive and mandated UI layout</li>
	<li>all-or-nothing approach to using framework</li>
</ul>
<p>
	For comparison, the base XForms implementation is around 280K,
	comprised of multiple source files and many additional classes.
	Because of the design of XForms, if an author wanted to use any
	control in the form, a special wrapper class had to be written
	to map between XForms and the native DWT controls.
	Meanwhile, ZForms is a single widget, DwtForm, that is under 25K.
</p>
<p>
	XForms also has a tightly coupled layout and modeling
	description.
	Authors cannot create their own layout and must adapt their
	interface to a strict table-based grid style layout.
	In addition, legacy or custom data objects can not be used
	transparently with XForms.
</p>

<a name='why'></a>
<h2>Why?</h2>
<p>
	With the existence of the XForms implementation the question
	arises: why ZForms?
	Because of the complexity of XForms and the annoyance of coding
	everything by hand, there is a need for a solution in between XForms
	and pure code.
	ZForms' layered approach fills this need.
</p>
<p>
	Authors can use ZForms as a simple way of constructing and
	populating a complex control but still attach all of the event
	listeners and handle the data-binding logic by hand.
	Or they can populate the control and set the visibility or whether
	controls are enabled directly within the ZForms form description.
	Or they can populate the control, manage visibility of components,
	and bind all of the controls to any arbitrary JavaScript object.
	The choice is theirs.
</p>

<a name='using'></a>
<h2>Using ZForms</h2>
<p>
	The ZForms framework (if you can call it that) takes a layered
	approach to solving this common problem.
	The author can take advantage of as little or as much of the ZForms
	functionality as they want.
	As such, the documentation for ZForms is separated into a series of
	tutorials, ordered from simple to more complex uses of ZForms:
</p>
<ul>
	<li><a href='zforms-intro.html'>Getting Started</a></li>
	<li><a href='zforms-handlers.html'>Attaching Handlers</a></li>
	<li><a href='zforms-binding.html'>Binding Objects</a></li>
</ul>
