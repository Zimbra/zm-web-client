ABOUT

In addition to compiling Java source code and generating the
web application .war file, the build process also:

* combines images into icon map files
* combines JavaScript source into package files
* compiles advanced client templates


IMAGE MERGE

For performance, groups of similar images are combined into a
single icon file. This reduces the number of requests from the
client to the server for the images used in the application.

//depot/{branch}/ZimbraWebClient/WebRoot/img/

This directory contains all of the images used by the user clients.
The images in each sub-directory are combined into a single GIF file
of all of the images with the name {dirname}.gif. In addition, CSS
selectors are generated for each image.

PACKAGE JAMMING

The JavaScript source is organized into packages. Each package is
defined by a manifest that lists each source file in the package.
The package manifests can be found in the package/ sub-directories
in the JavaScript source tree of ZimbraWebClient:

//depot/{branch}/ZimbraWebClient/WebRoot/js/ajax/package/
//depot/{branch}/ZimbraWebClient/WebRoot/js/zimbra/package/
//depot/{branch}/ZimbraWebClient/WebRoot/js/zimbraAdmin/package/
//depot/{branch}/ZimbraWebClient/WebRoot/js/zimbraMail/package/

During the  build, each package manifest is scanned for the list
of source files in that package. For each package, two files are
created:

* a JSP file with a <script> tag for each source file
* a single JavaScript file with all of the source files combined

After the aggregated JavaScript package is generated, the source
file is minimized, a license header is prepended, and it is
compressed using GZip. For example, the following shows the source,
build, and deployed files for the "Ajax" package in the js/ajax/
source tree:

source:   //depot/{branch}/ZimbraWebClient/WebRoot/js/ajax/package/Ajax.js
build:    //depot/{branch}/ZimbraWebClient/build/WebRoot/js/Ajax_all.js.zgz
deployed: /opt/zimbra/jetty/webapps/zimbra/js/Ajax_all.js.zgz

NOTE: The .zgz extension is used instead of .gz for the GZip'd
      files because of an Internet Explorer bug that would
      incorrectly retrieve the compressed file from the browser
      cache.

The *_all.js* files are only generated for a production build and
loaded by the client when in a "prod" mode. If the user loads the
the client in "dev" mode, all of the JavaScript files are loaded
immediately (not deferred) and are loaded individually. In order
to load the user client in dev mode, add the "dev=1" parameter to
the URL.

COMPILE TEMPLATES

The template system is a very powerful feature that allows HTML
elements of the user interface to be customized. This allows skin
authors to change the appearance of user interface components such
as buttons, etc.

The template files are HTML files that contain <template> tags to
define each template. For the client to use these templates, they
must be compiled to native JavaScript during the build. Skin templates,
however, are compiled by the zmskindeploy script when deployed.

The source, compiled, and deployed templates are found at the following
locations:

source:   //depot/{branch}/ZimbraWebClient/WebRoot/templates/
build:    //depot/{branch}/ZimbraWebClient/build/WebRoot/templates/
deployed: /opt/zimbra/jetty/webapps/zimbra/templates/

NOTE: The entire product has NOT been converted to using the
      template system. Therefore, not every user interface can be
      customized by a skin.
