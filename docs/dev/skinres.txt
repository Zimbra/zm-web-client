ABOUT

The Zimbra web client allows customization using skins (also known as
themes). Skins are collection of files that define the HTML layout, CSS
styles, images, and text messages.


STRUCTURE AND CONTENTS

Each skin is a separate directory at this location and is a set of
resource files and a manifest file. The manifest file lists all of the
files that apply to the standard or advanced clients or both.

All of the default skins that ship with ZCS are found at the following
location:

source:     //depot/{branch}/ZimbraWebClient/WebRoot/skins/
deployed:   /opt/zimbra/jetty/webapps/zimbra/skins/

and may contain the following files:

* manifest.xml (required)
* skin.properties
* skin.html
* skin.css
* skin.js
* ...

The skin can define its own resources or rely on resources from another
(or a base) skin. Most skins use the base skin resources located at:

	//depot/{branch}/ZimbraWebClient/WebRoot/skins/_base/base2/

RESOURCES

The skin resources are processed and aggregated for the client by the
SkinResources servlet. The request URL to this servlet can contain a
comma-separate list of resources of a given resource type. For example:

	http://example.com/zimbra/css/common,dwt,skin.css

For each item in the comma-separated list (e.g. "common", "dwt", and
"skin"), the resources are combined for the client. The result is
processed to replace substitution values defined by the skin's manifest.
If the item in the comma-separated list is "skin", the servlet reads
the skin's manifest file to determine the set of files to aggregate
for the request type. Otherwise, the file contents comes from resource
directory specified in the request URL. For example, the "common" item
corresponds to /zimbra/css/common.css.

Complete skin details can be found in the Themes document.

CHAMELEON SKIN

The chameleon skin is *not* a skin at all. Instead, it is a collection
of LDAP attributes that affect the appearance of *all* of the skins for
a given domain or all domains. When set, the chameleon values override
colors and logos in the skin resources.

zimbraSkinForegroundColor

	Foreground (or text) in the user interface. Default is black.
	This value is rarely changed and may have unexepected results
	if changed to a non-dark color.

zimbraSkinBackgroundColor

	Background in the user interface. This is the primary color of the
	user interface. Other colors in the user interface are based on this
	color (i.e. lighter and darker shades for borders, etc).

	SEE: zimbraSkinSecondaryColor

zimbraSkinSecondaryColor

	Secondary color in the user interface. This color is used in most
	skins for accented elements such as the selected app, the app toolbar,
	etc.

	SEE: zimbraSkinBackgroundColor

zimbraSkinSelectionColor

	Selection color in the user inteface. This color is used to highlight
	selected items in lists and pop-up menus.

zimbraSkinLogoLoginBanner

	URL of the logo that appears on the login page. Recommend to use
	absolute URLs but you can use relative URLs if the image is on
	the deployment server accessible to the web application.

	SEE: zimbraSkinLogoAppBanner

zimbraSkinLogoAppBanner

	URL of the logo that appears in the main app. Recommend to use
	absolute URLs but you can use relative URLs if the image is on
	the deployment server accessible to the web application.

	SEE: zimbraSkinLogoLoginBanner

zimbraSkinFavicon

	URL of the browser favorite icon. Recommend to use absolute URLs
	but you can use relative URLs if the icon is on the deployment
	server accessible to the web application.

	NOTE: Older versions of ZCS did not support this attribute.

NOTE: The overrides only work on skins that use the same property names
      as the default skins. If you use custom skins, some or all of these
      attributes may have no effect on the skin seen by the user.
