ABOUT
The Zimbra Collaboration suite will have a Chat application tightly integrated to it.
This is made possible using Converse.js as the XMPP JS library. This document lists the packages used,
building/installing the packages, configuring them and how the integration/execution happens within ZCS web client.

PACKAGES
1.) Converse.js (Available at https://github.com/jcbrand/converse.js/releases/tag/v0.9.1)
|
|-> npm (node_modules)
|	If you don't have node/npm installed then you may visit => https://nodejs.org/ for more installation and setup information.
|
|-> bower
|	Note - The bower.json has an entry for crypto-js that had to be changed in v0.9.1.
|		   while doing "make build" the 'JSMIN' target failed and hence changed the bower.json
|
|-> grunt
|
|-> grunt-cli

Steps:
a.) Once npm/nodejs is setup, go to Terminal -> go to conversejs source folder -> execute following commands:
	$> npm install
	$> bower update
	$> grunt jst
	$> make build

	Note - If you are behind a corporate proxy then export http_proxy, https_proxy env variables first and do
		   "sudo npm install"

		   In case bower update fails then you might need to set proxy for GIT commands.

2.) Ejabberd
-> A local copy of XMPP server to make chat work in the DEV environment.

BUILD PROCESS
-> Using the 'make' file available in Converse package.
-> 'make dev' will get you a developer build. For more information visit => https://conversejs.org/docs/html/development.html
-> 'make build' will get you a production build. For more information visit => https://conversejs.org/docs/html/builds.html

The build process (make build) will go through a series of build targets and it is better to ensure all the targets pass.
Targets:
a.) jst:compile
b.) cssmin:minify
c.) jsmin

CONFIGURATION
-> UI Integration:
   Getting started with basic set of config is pretty simple. Just copy-paste the below code to your JS init function and we are good to go:

	require(['converse'], function (converse) {
	    converse.initialize({
	        auto_list_rooms: false,
	        auto_subscribe: false,
	        bosh_service_url: 'http://localhost:5280/http-bind', // To be replaced with BOSH URL received from the server.
	        hide_muc_server: false,
	        i18n: locales.en,
	        //keepalive: true, // used while prebind auth
	        //jid: appCtxt.getLoggedInUsername(), // used while prebind auth
	        //prebind: true, // used while prebind auth
	        show_controlbox_by_default: true,
	        roster_groups: true
	    });
	});

INTEGRATION
-> The way Converse.js is coupled in ZCS UI code.

EXECUTION
-> Launching the chat application along with ZCS.

TEMPLATING and CUSTOMIZATION
-> The templates are available at -> /converse.js-0.9.1/src/templates
-> These are available as .html files to us, for more information visit => https://conversejs.org/docs/html/theming.html#id3
-> Once changes are done to template files you need to run the 'make build' target that merges the content of these template files to converse.js

PATCHES
-> In order to help with the upgrade we will be using patches for all the changes done to Converse.js. Make any changes to the converse.js javascript and templates file and run following command in ZimbraWebclient/converse directory

# make

This will build the converse.js and also create a new patch diff file called work.diff.
When your changes looks good copy this diff file into the patches directory and rename it with a sequential number for eg. 01-bug-xxxx.diff

# cp work.diff patches/01-bug-xxxx.diff

Make sure to use sequential numbering for the start of the patch, and that the
number is greater than the other existing patches. Otherwise, the patches may
fail to apply.
