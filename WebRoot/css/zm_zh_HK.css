/*
* Conventions
*
* - Classes that start with "Dwt" or "Zm" have a corollary Javascript object.
* - Use one line if there is only one selector and one declaration. Otherwise, indent each declaration on its own line.
* - Group selectors to avoid repetition of styles, as appropriate (ie group within a section). That means you may have
*   to look at more than one definition to figure out all the applicable styles, but it lets you give the styles a
*   hierarchy. That way, you're more likely to need to change a style in just one place.
* - Use shorthand styles when possible (font, margin, padding, etc).
* - When grouping selectors that correspond to our Javascript objects, show inheritance by using a different line for
*   each level of inheritance. CSS doesn't care about our object hierarchy, but doing that enhances readability.
* - Use hex RGB values for colors that don't have names (eg:  #EEEEEE)
* - Try to stick to hex values of   00, 33, 66, 99, AA, FF so they map cleanly to the web palette,
*    eg: #666666 rather than #616161
* - Modifiers are lower case, whether they're a class (eg .hover) or tacked on (eg -selected).
*
* Classes are laid out in the following general order:
*	- HTML elements
*	- General app stuff (shell, overlays, banner)
*	- Widgets that tend toward abstract (minimal subclassing), such as tool tips and sashes
*	- Heavier use widgets such as buttons and dialogs
*		- General widget stuff, then specialized subclasses
*	- List views, with common stuff first
*	- Other views (lots of them)
*	- Miscellaneous stuff that multiple apps might use (objects, autocomplete)
*	- Modifiers
*
* Many of the Dwt widgets don't have corresponding classes here, since they are only subclassed.
