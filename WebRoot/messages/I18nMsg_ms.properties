# Add as many regexes as you'd like (without holes in the numbering sequence). They will in turn test the user input until a match is found.

# When the optional ampm group is present in a match, 12 hours will be converted to 0 hours, and when the matched value is present in 
# the parseTimePMChars value, 12 hours will be added to the time.
