NOTE: it should not happen, but if for some reason updating this file does not cause a recompile of the files including it
(currently launchZCS and launchNewWindow), make sure you touch those files too to test.
I tested on my Jetty and it does recognize included files and recompiles the files that include them. But just in case.
